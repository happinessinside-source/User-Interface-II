  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Hello, I'm DeAnna. I'm a web developer who studied at Lambda School. Lambda School is a fully immersive, hands on, online program with some of the best instructors and staff in the world. I was able to learn so much and the experience has been so much fun. During my time spent at Lambda I was able to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript and so much more. I've learned about Github, what the job market is like for a developer, and how to form connections. Lambda has offered me a wealth of knowledge that reaches far beyond any other educational program I've ever been in. I am beyond grateful for the opportunity. </p>
